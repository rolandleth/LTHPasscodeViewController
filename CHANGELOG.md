# 3.0.2
Renamed `SFHFKeychainUtils` to `LTHKeychainUtils` due to the possibility of conflicts with a version already present in the project. `LTHKeychainUtils` differs from the original library only by being ARC-compliant, so all the rights and thanks go to the original author, [Buzz Anders](https://github.com/ldandersen).

# 3.0.1
* Added `+deletePasscodeAndClose`.
* Improved doc a bit.

# 3.0.0

* Transformed all macros and constants into public properties. They were created before turning the control into a pod and the idea was to ease the init, but since I created the pod I never realized they get overwritten when updating.
* Now supports pushing the controller.
* Now supports saving and reading the passcode and timers in a custom location other than the Keychain. New delegate methods to handle this.
* A more comprehensive documentation.

Please swap the deprecated methods with the suggested ones; I will remove them in the next release.
